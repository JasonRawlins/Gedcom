Move DeveloperTree


Backlog
-------
The BIRT fact in @P1@ needs sources and I need to find them in code.
What do I do with the sources after I find them? Where is the list of sources I need to populate?

Make a Visual Studio addon that formats .ged files. There might already be one.

Make a postbuild event that removes leading spaces from FormattedDeveloperTree.ged and copies it to DeveloperTree.ged.
I've already started this in PostBuildEvent.bat.
<Target Name="PostBuild" AfterTargets="PostBuildEvent">
	<Exec Command="call &quot;$(ProjectDir)\PostBuildEvent.bat&quot; &quot;$(ProjectDir)Resources\FormattedDeveloperTree.ged&quot; &quot;$(TargetDir)Resources\DeveloperTree.ged&quot;&#xD;&#xA;" />
</Target>
