  <p>Welcome to the Gedcom.NET Genes and Genealogy site. This is a demonstration of how Gedcom.NET might be used to create a custom site for displaying genealogical information from a gedcom file.</p>
  <p>You can start exploring the site by viewing the profile of the fictional person Dylan Davis. His profile has the most complete collection of events, sources, and relationships. The Aberystwyth University is the most complete source.</p>
  <a class="demo-person-link" [routerLink]="['/profile', profile.individual.xref]">
    <app-profile-header [individual]="profile.individual" [portraitUrl]="profile.portraitUrl"></app-profile-header>
  </a>
  <p>Or you can view <a [routerLink]="['/tree']">all people in the tree</a> as a list.</p>
  <p>The gedcom file used for this site was generated from a fictional tree on Ancestry.com named <a href="https://www.ancestry.com/family-tree/tree/207650121/" target="_blank">GedcomNetTestTree</a></p>
  <p>You can view the code in the <a href="https://github.com/JasonRawlins/Gedcom" target="_blank">Gedcom repository on Github</a></p>
